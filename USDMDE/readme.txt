
     Ultimate Soccer Manager Data Editor for USM 98, 98/99 (UK,US,DE,FR)
              Version 4.20d  July 29, 2001


Thank you for downloading USM D.E. 4!!

From version 4, I'll officially announce that you can use USM D.E. 4 with
DSF Fuﬂballmanager 98, 98/99 or Football Manager 98, 98/99.
But any problems with these non-English editions are out of my supports.



HOW TO USE
------------
-Simply extract all 5 files to the same directory (except Desktop) and READ HELP FILE.
 (According to some reports, problem may happen if you place USM D.E. 4 on your Windows Desktop.)

-If you want to uninstall, simply delete all files in your USM Data Editor directory.
 USM D.E. 4 generates no registry entries. 

<<IMPORTANT>>
-YOU SHOULD USE THIS EDITOR AT YOUR OWN RISK.
-DON'T FORGET TO MAKE BACKUPS BEFORE USING THIS EDITOR.


Known problems
----------------
-In playing your half-customized tournament;
 Even if you edited teamwc.dat and playerwc.dat in Create half-customized tournament menu,
 you can't change uniforms completely. (I know how to change main color of uniform, but I
 don't know how to change complete uniform layout.)

-Derby settings in Dutch league (USM 98/99 only);
 You can't edit derby settings in Dutch league because Sierra's programmers
 made one small mistake in Dutch league files. (USM is great, but has some bugs, you know...)

-Side in Extra players (USM 98/99 only);
 When you try to edit Extra players, his side is not reflected correctly in the game play.
 I think it's a bug of USM 98/99. It's not always serious, but please edit carefully...

-Player's transfer histories in the game play;
 USM Data Editor can load player's transfer history correctly, but usm98.exe can't
 load perfectly. So when you edit transfer histories, sometimes they may not be
 appeared correctly in the game play. It's a fault of Sierra's programmers. 
 (USM is great, but has some bugs, you know...)


Questions, ideas... email me.
